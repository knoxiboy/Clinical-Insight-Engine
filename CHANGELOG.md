## [1.0.0] — 2025-05-28

### Added

#### Core Application
- Full-stack clinical decision support system for early diabetes risk detection
- Python-based interpretable machine learning model using Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
- React + TypeScript frontend with Vite for fast development builds
- Express.js REST API backend with PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- Zod-based schema validation across frontend and backend routes
- TanStack Query for server state management and data fetching

#### Risk Assessment
- Patient intake form accepting: age, gender, hypertension status, heart disease history, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level
- Confidence-aware risk predictions (0–100%) with interpretable factor contributions
- Risk categorisation into LOW / MODERATE / HIGH levels

#### Dual-View Results Interface
- **Clinician View** — exact risk percentage, top contributing factors with impact scores, model confidence indicators, and suggested follow-up actions
- **Patient View** — simplified risk category, plain-language explanations of contributing factors, and preventive lifestyle recommendations

#### Data Visualisation
- Interactive bar charts displaying feature contributions in the clinician view (Recharts)
- Framer Motion animations for smooth UI transitions

#### Assessment History
- Persistent storage of previous assessments with timestamps via PostgreSQL
- Enables longitudinal tracking of individual patient risk over time

#### Machine Learning Pipeline (`analyze.py`)
- Logistic Regression model trained on the diabetes dataset
- Feature engineering and preprocessing pipeline
- StandardScaler normalisation for numeric inputs
- Synthetic data generation fallback (`create_synthetic_data()`) when dataset is unavailable
- Single-patient prediction via `patient.json` file interface (`analyze.py predict_file`)
- Note: `main.py` is a Replit workspace stub and is not part of the ML pipeline

#### Security
- `helmet` middleware for HTTP security headers on all API responses
- `express-rate-limit` for API rate limiting to mitigate abuse
- `express-session` with `connect-pg-simple` for secure, database-backed session storage
- `passport` + `passport-local` for local authentication strategy
- OTP step in the login flow for simulated two-factor verification
- `.env` / `.env.local` separation to prevent secrets from being committed
- Development-only credential bypass is stripped from production builds

#### Developer Experience
- PostgreSQL preflight check on server startup — fails fast with a clear error if the database is unreachable
- Cross-platform setup instructions (Linux, macOS, Windows PowerShell / cmd)
- Python virtual environment support with `requirements.txt`

#### Project Governance
- `README.md` with full setup guide, architecture overview, and feature documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines for open-source contributors
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` based on community standards
- `ANALYSIS_README.md` documenting the ML analysis pipeline
- MIT License
